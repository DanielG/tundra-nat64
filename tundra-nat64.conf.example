# ----- Tundra-NAT64 example configuration file -----

# Tundra can be instructed to stop reading the configuration file (before the end of the file) using a line containing
# only the string "!STOP" (without the quotation marks, case-sensitive). If such line is encountered, the program stops
# reading the config file immediately and the open file is closed. This can be useful for example when the program's
# config is read from a named pipe, standard input etc.



# The number of threads used to translate packets.
# If set to 0, the number of CPUs (cores, SMT threads, ...) your device has is used.

# more than one translator thread is configured.

# Specifies the "means" by which the translator will receive and send packets.
# There are two I/O modes: 'inherited-fds' and 'tun'.
#
# In the 'tun' I/O mode, Tundra initializes a TUN network interface according to the io.tun.* configuration options
# specified below, and uses it to receive and send packets.
# NOTE: If Tundra is configured to have more than one translator thread, the TUN interface is initialized as multi-queue
# (using the IFF_MULTI_QUEUE flag), so that it can be used from all the translator threads. Each thread is assigned a
# single queue (file descriptor), and since it is completely up to the kernel to which queue incoming packets are
# placed, it is possible that even if some threads are fully busy, other threads might not be getting any packets at
# the same time.
#
# In the 'inherited-fds' I/O mode, Tundra inherits file descriptors from the program that executed it - their numbers
# are passed to Tundra using the '-f' or '--inherited-fds' command-line option:
#  -f, --inherited-fds=THREAD1_IN,THREAD1_OUT[;THREAD2_IN,THREAD2_OUT]...
# Each translator thread is assigned a pair of file descriptors that it will then use to receive (THREAD*_IN) and send
# (THREAD*_OUT) packets (therefore, you must pass as many file descriptor pairs to the program as there are translator
# threads). Keep in mind that the program is primarily designed to work with TUN interface's file descriptors;
# therefore, the inherited ones must behave similarly, namely:
#  - each read() call on THREAD*_IN file descriptor must return a single whole packet
#  - each write() call on THREAD*_OUT file descriptor must accept a single whole packet up to MTU bytes in size
# This means that only file descriptors which preserve message boundaries and have sufficient read/write buffers may be
# used. Specifically, datagram (!) sockets created using socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_DGRAM) whose buffers' sizes have been
# properly adjusted using setsockopt(SO_RCVBUF) and setsockopt(SO_SNDBUF) meet these requirements (whereas, for example,
# pipes do not, since they do not preserve message boundaries).

# Specifies how the translator will translate IP addresses when translating packets from one protocol to another.
# There are two translator modes: 'nat64' and 'clat'.
#
# In the 'nat64' translator mode, packets' IP addresses are (statelessly) translated the following way:
# * IPv6-Packet(src='translator.ipv6', dst='translator.prefix' + any-valid-IPv4-address) --> IPv4-Packet(src='translator.ipv4', dst=the-valid-IPv4-address)
# * IPv4-Packet(src=any-valid-IPv4-address, dst='translator.ipv4') --> IPv6-Packet(src='translator.prefix' + the-valid-IPv4-address, dst='translator.ipv6')
#
# In the 'clat' translator mode, packets' IP addresses are (statelessly) translated the following way:
# * IPv4-Packet(src='translator.ipv4', dst=any-valid-IPv4-address) --> IPv6-Packet(src='translator.ipv6', dst='translator.prefix' + the-valid-IPv4-address)
# * IPv6-Packet(src='translator.prefix' + any-valid-IPv4-address, dst='translator.ipv6') --> IPv4-Packet(src=the-valid-IPv4-address, dst='translator.ipv4')
#
# Tundra itself cannot act as a NAT64/CLAT translator for more than one host, as it lacks an internal dynamic address
# pool from which it would assign addresses to hosts needing its service - it only uses the single IPv4 and IPv6
# address configurable below. However, you can use Tundra in cooperation with Linux's in-kernel NAT66/NAT44, which can
# masquerade a whole network requesting NAT64/CLAT service behind 'translator.ipv6'/'translator.ipv4', for example:
#  ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 64:ff9b::/96 -o tundra -j SNAT --to-source=fd00:6464::2  # For NAT64
#  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o tundra -j SNAT --to-source=192.168.64.2  # For CLAT
translator.mode = nat64

# These options specify the IP addresses the translator will use when translating packets from one protocol to another.
#
# The length of 'translator.prefix' is fixed to be 96 bits (/96), which is probably the only prefix length used in
# production NAT64 deployments. The length shall not be specified in the option's value. Tundra does not support other
# prefix lengths.
#
# RFC 6052 states that the well-known prefix (64:ff9b::/96) must not be used to represent non-global IPv4 addresses.
# For this reason, Tundra offers the 'translator.allow_translation_of_private_ips' option which should be set to 'no'
# if you are using the well-known prefix (which will cause all packets containing problematic addresses to be silently
# dropped). Keep in mind that the option only affects IPv4 addresses embedded into the prefix - 'translator.ipv4' and
# 'router.ipv4' can be private even if the option is set to 'no'.

# IPv4 packets contain the ToS field and IPv6 packets contain the Traffic Class field, both of which nowadays normally
# consist of the DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) and ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) fields. However,
# in some legacy networks, the IPv4 ToS field might be used with old semantics which are not compatible with IPv6. To
# prevent problems in such networks, Tundra can be instructed not to copy the fields over and zero them out instead
# using these options.
# In the vast majority of cases, however, this is not a problem, and so you can leave these options enabled.
